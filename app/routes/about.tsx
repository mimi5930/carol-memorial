          Carol's Obituary
        </h2>
        <p>
          Carol A. Trainor, age 58, of Hudson, Wisconsin, passed away on May 5,
          2025. Carol was born October 20, 1966 in St. Paul, MN to Richard and
          Louise (Thompson) Weiher. She married Chad Trainor on September 1,
          1993 in Milwaukee, WI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carol was a Hudson native and graduated from Hudson High School in
          1985 and went on to earn a degree in Applied Mathematics from UW-River
          Falls. A lifelong lover of music, Carol accompanied her school choirs
          on piano growing up, served as a pianist for the Hudson United
          Methodist Church for over a decade, and was the accompanist of the
          Hudson Middle School Choirs for the past several years. She performed
          in multiple handbell choirs since her teenage years, including the
          Weigand Ringers, Alleluia Ringers, and Gospbells with her mother,
          sister, and several friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carol and her husband Chad became the owners of Urban Olive and Vine
          in 2018. Carol was a fixture in Urban who was always easy to spot with
          her funky colored hair. She wore many hats in her role, including
          server, barista, cook, bookkeeper, and community ambassador. Carol's
          greatest joy and accomplishment at Urban, however, was by far being a
          mentor to the teens she worked with. From providing a safe space to
          express themselves, to tutoring them with their math homework, to
          being someone they could always confide in, she cared for her young
          employees like family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carol loved gardening, crocheting, and spending time with her family.
          She loved living in the same city as her mother, sister, and beloved
          nieces and nephew. She loved to relax on her patio swing on a hot
          summer evening and admire her show-stopping garden. She crocheted a
          blanket and scarf for just about everyone in her family. Above all,
          Carol dedicated her life to loving and caring for her children and
          husband, who adored her in return, and she loved nothing more than
          spending every second she could with her beloved granddaughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carol is survived by her loving husband of nearly 32 years, Chad;
          daughter, Brianna (Matthew Schiessl); son, Morgan (Michael Miller);
          mother, Louise Weiher; sister Diane (Leif) Hallen; granddaughter,
          Lydia; nieces and nephew, Mariah, Sarah, Jenna, and Nicholas; and many
          other loving cousins and relatives. She was preceded in death by her
          father, Richard Weiher.
        </p>
        <p>
          A visitation open to the public will be 2-6 PM Friday June 20 and 11
          AM - 3 PM Saturday June 21 at the O’Connell Family Funeral Home in
          Hudson, WI. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the family
          which will be used to establish a memorial fund by Carol’s family,
          which will be for the purpose of giving back to the Hudson Area
          community in her memory.
